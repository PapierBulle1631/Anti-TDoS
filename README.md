# Anti-TDoS
Anti-TDoS Android App This Android app helps detect and block high volumes of incoming calls, which may indicate a potential TDoS (Telephony Denial of Service) attack. It monitors incoming calls, checks for suspicious call patterns (more than 3 calls in a minute), and can automatically block calls after detecting a possible attack.
